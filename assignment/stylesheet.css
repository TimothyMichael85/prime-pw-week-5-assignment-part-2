/* ## Assignment - Practice with HTML & CSS

Time to make our index.html page look cool!

Add all CSS through a Stylesheet. Do not use inline styles.

Update the HTML:

- Place the existing `h1` inside a `header` element. 
- Add an `h2` element into the `header` that says `YOUR NAME's Record Shop`.
- Place the existing `p` inside a `main` element.

Add a Stylesheet:

- Create a `stylesheet.css` file and source it into the HTML file.
- Give the `header` a dark background color and choose a light  color for the text.
- Center the text in the `header`.
- Give the `main` a light grey background color.
- Look up the CSS `background-image` property to learn how to use the provided `record.png` as the background image on your page with a relative path.
- Look up CSS `background-repeat` to learn how to fill the body of the page with a repeating image.
- Look up CSS `margin` and `padding`. 
  - Give the `body` a margin of `0`. (This removes the whitespace around the edges of the page.) 
  - Give the `main` padding of `1em`. (Curious about `em`? Look up CSS units.)

Here's an example of what the style could look like:
<img src="./example.png">

__STRETCH GOAL:__ Use CSS style classes vs element names to do your styling, except for adding the margin to the `body`. That is a good thing to add to every CSS file, and it should use the `body` HTML tag name. */

header {
    text-align: center;
    background-color: indigo;
    color: ivory;
}

main{
    background-color: lightgray;
    padding: 1em;
 

}

body{
    margin: 0;
    background-image: url(/Users/timanderson/Desktop/prime/tier-1/week5/prime-pw-week-5-assignment-part-2/assignment/record.png);

       /* Regarding the question, "Look up CSS `background-repeat` to learn how to fill the body of the page with a repeating image." 
       
       Looking at w3 schools, 'background-image' repeats horizontally and vertically (which fills out the page) by default. Wouldn't 'background-repeat' be used to modify that default? For example, if you only wanted to have the image display once, you would want to use 'background-repeat: no-repeat;' Or am I just misunderstanding whet's being asked in the assignment? */
